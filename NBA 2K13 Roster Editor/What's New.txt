Version History

	v0.23 (contributed by TUSS11)
		- added ability to change the jersey art (for the purpose of duplicating jerseys to have alternate accessory colors). Current teams only.
		- added "Practice" to jersey names
		- added a fix to jersey names so the name shows up at the team select screen if you change it in Roster Editor
		- IMPORTANT: do not change the Art for the first jersey. It needs to be the Sixer's home practice jersey. The program calculates the values of all jerseys based on it's value.		

	v0.22.4.3
		- Fixed crash in very rare occurrences related to window icon

	v0.22.4.2
		- Fixed the tool crashing on startup in some occurrences when a registry setting was saved in the wrong format

	v0.22.4.1
		- Made the "missing column headers" message a bit more helpful

	v0.22.4
		- Added Shoe Trim parameters to Players (code contribution of TUSS11 from OperationSports)

	v0.22.3.3
		- Fixed saving Free Agents

	v0.22.3.2
		- Player with ID 1364 will be skipped when saving the Players tab while using the 360 profile; editing the player in that spot doesn't work, and that's a known issue, so this will make sure the tool doesn't try to save him and thus doesn't show a message about an error during save

	v0.22.3.1
		- Fixed Free Agents entry for all save types
		- Disabled Team Stats editing for MyCareer saves as the offset can't be automatically determined for now

	v0.22.3
		- Jerseys table will now begin with the training jerseys which are earlier in the roster file

	v0.22.2
		- Added "ContYBefOpt" (Contract Years Before Option) parameter in Players tab; will be automatically calculated upon save, no need to edit it manually

	v0.22.1
		- Added "Fix Waived RFAs" in Players tab; allows you to unset the RFA flag in players that are currently free-agents (meant to only be used outside of the off-season)

	v0.22
		- IsFA column is now IsFA1, added second IsFA parameter as IsFA2; don't know what their difference is, they're the same in most players in the Players table
		- Added RFA column which determines whether a player will be an RFA when they go into free agency
		- Fixed bug which would alter the value of whether a player would become a restricted or unrestricted free agent incorrectly; if your Upcoming FA shows all players as restricted, your save has been corrupted, and you'll need to copy over the RFA values from a previous, uncorrupted one
		- Fixed the Players table not showing up correctly when switching back from the Auto 360 profile to Auto PC

	v0.21.2
		- Added "Fix ALL IsFA" in Players tab; allows you to automatically set the IsFA flag to true for players in the FA pool, and to false for everyone else

	v0.21.1
		- Changed IsFA* column to IsInFAPool* and included editable IsFA column; this way the tool won't automatically decide on whether to set a player as a Free Agent depending on whether he's assigned to a team or the FA pool
		- Added "Fix IsFA for FAs" in Players tab; allows you to automatically set IsFA to "true" for all players in the Free Agents pool
		- Fixed 360 compatibility

	v0.21
		- Roster Editor will automatically detect the offsets when loading any compatible file, no matter if game mode save or roster

	v0.20.1
		- Errors while saving the Players tab should not result in the tool crashing anymore; they'll be reported to the tracelog.txt file and a message will be shown to the user; the tool will try to save the rest of the players anyway

	v0.20.0.1

		- The Random operator in Find & Replace has been changed to =Rand

	v0.19.3
		- Find & Replace can now replace values with random ones within a range by using the Random operator and entering the minimum and maximum as the value separated by a semicolon (e.g. RPot Random 30;80 will generate random potential ratings for the matching players between 30 and 80)
