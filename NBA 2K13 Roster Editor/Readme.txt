NBA 2K13 Roster Editor
	by Lefteris "Leftos" Aslanoglou

	Quick Notes
		I'll be trying to automate and program any roster hex edits we discover before REDitor comes out.

		Make note that Player ID isn't the same as CFID or any other ID. The Player ID just denotes the position of the player in the player table of the roster.

		Any hex edits that you discover and you want me to implement, post here: http://forums.nba-live.com/viewtopic.php?f=150&t=88190

		If you're having issues with pasting into the tables, read the included "Pasting into the tables Tutorial.pdf" file.

			
	Known Issues
		- (X360) Editing Signature Skills of player with Player ID 1364 doesn't work for now
