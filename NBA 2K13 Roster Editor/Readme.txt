NBA 2K13 Roster Editor
	by Lefteris "Leftos" Aslanoglou

	Quick Notes
		I'll be trying to automate and program any roster hex edits we discover before REDitor comes out.

		Make note that Player ID isn't the same as CFID or any other ID. The Player ID just denotes the position of the player in the player table of the roster.

		Any hex edits that you discover and you want me to implement, post here: http://forums.nba-live.com/viewtopic.php?f=150&t=88190

		If you're having issues with pasting into the tables, read the included "Pasting into the tables Tutorial.pdf" file.

			
	Known Issues
		- (360) Editing any player that is in the spot with ID 1364 won't work; some of the information shown may be incorrect as well
		- (360) MyCareer files compatibility is ...well, not that good
		
		
	Disclaimer
		As with any editing tool, you should always keep backups of any files you edit. There might be bugs I am not aware of, and new features might bring new bugs of their own. So always, always keep backups. I will not be held responsible for any corruption caused to your saves.
