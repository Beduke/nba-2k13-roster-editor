		- Changed IsFA* column to IsInFAPool* and included editable IsFA column; this way the tool won't automatically decide on whether to set a player as a Free Agent depending on whether he's assigned to a team or the FA pool
		- Added "Fix IsFA for FAs" in Players tab; allows you to automatically set IsFA to "true" for all players in the Free Agents pool
		- Fixed 360 compatibility
