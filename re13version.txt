	v0.23 (contributed by TUSS11)
		- added ability to change the jersey art (for the purpose of duplicating jerseys to have alternate accessory colors). Current teams only.
		- added "Practice" to jersey names
		- added a fix to jersey names so the name shows up at the team select screen if you change it in Roster Editor
		- IMPORTANT: do not change the Art for the first jersey. It needs to be the Sixer's home practice jersey. The program calculates the values of all jerseys based on it's value.
