	v0.22.3.2
		- Player with ID 1364 will be skipped when saving the Players tab while using the 360 profile; editing the player in that spot doesn't work, and that's a known issue, so this will make sure the tool doesn't try to save him and thus doesn't show a message about an error during save

	v0.22.3.1
		- Fixed Free Agents entry for all save types
		- Disabled Team Stats editing for MyCareer saves as the offset can't be automatically determined for now
