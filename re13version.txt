	v0.22.2
		- Added "ContYBefOpt" (Contract Years Before Option) parameter in Players tab; will be automatically calculated upon save, no need to edit it manually

	v0.22.1
		- Added "Fix Waived RFAs" in Players tab; allows you to unset the RFA flag in players that are currently free-agents (meant to only be used outside of the off-season)

	v0.22
		- IsFA column is now IsFA1, added second IsFA parameter as IsFA2; don't know what their difference is, they're the same in most players in the Players table
		- Added RFA column which determines whether a player will be an RFA when they go into free agency
		- Fixed bug which would alter the value of whether a player would become a restricted or unrestricted free agent incorrectly; if your Upcoming FA shows all players as restricted, your save has been corrupted, and you'll need to copy over the RFA values from a previous, uncorrupted one
		- Fixed the Players table not showing up correctly when switching back from the Auto 360 profile to Auto PC
